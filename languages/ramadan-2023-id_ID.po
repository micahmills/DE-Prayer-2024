"Mahmoud is a young man from Upper Egypt whose family lives in a small "

"going to work. His uncle put him to work all day and as the day ended, he "

"locked him in a dark room above his suit factory. Mahmoud was afraid and sat "
"in a corner with his legs pulled up against his chest and arms wrapped "

"wrote some Koranic verses on special paper, placed it in water to dissolve "
"and had him drink it. This was the start of a life of traveling and working "

"He had never had an encounter with a Christian before and didn’t know much "
